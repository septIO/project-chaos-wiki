All players start with the **Chaotic Crafting** profession, allowing them to create randomly generated items, transmute [crafting orbs](crafting%20materials.md), and craft [Gems](gems.md).  
_Note: Items crafted through Chaotic Crafting can also drop naturally._

Chaotic Crafting remains useful throughout your journey and never becomes obsolete. As you level up, you’ll automatically unlock new recipes, granting access to stronger tools.

With dozens of recipes available, you’ll never be stuck waiting for the right drop—need gloves after 20 levels? Craft some. Items crafted will always match your level (_±5 levels up to 80_), ensuring they’re always relevant.

All items created through Chaotic Crafting are either **Magic** or **Rare**.

### Equipment
_**Any** means that the recipe will create an item for **any** equipment slot (e.g. bracers, boots, etc.)._
_**Specific** means that the recipe will create an item for that specific equipment slot (e.g. helmet, chest, etc.)._

Crafting equipment will always take your known armor/weapon proficiencies into account (unless you craft one of the **any** recipes). Crafting on a Mage will never give you plate armor.

### Chaotic Disassembly
Any item can be disassembled into its base components. This will destroy the item, but return some of the crafting materials used to create it. Think of this as "Disenchanting" in other games.

Chaotic Disassembly will never return *Orbs* or *Gems*.
