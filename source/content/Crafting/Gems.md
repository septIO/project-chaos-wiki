Gems are the final touch in crafting, allowing you to add up to **4** additional modifiers on top of an item's existing **6**. While these modifiers have a lower value range, they provide a way to refine and optimize powerful gear.

Gems can only be applied to items with an **empty gem socket**. You can create a gem socket by using a **Jeweler's Orb**, but each item can have only **one** socket.

Gems can be removed using a **Gemcutter's Prism**, returning the original gem intact. Like other items, gems can be [corrupted](corruption.md). Once corrupted, they **cannot** be removed.
