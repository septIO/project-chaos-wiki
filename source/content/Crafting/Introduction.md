Item crafting is the most important part of Project Chaos.
Our crafting system is *heavily* inspired by Path of Exile, and holds very similar mechanics.

An item's rarity is determined by the number of affixes it has. Common items have no affixes, uncommon items have 1-2 affixes, rare items have 3-5 affixes, epic items have 6 affixes.

Using crafting materials, you can add, remove, and change affixes on items.
See [Crafting materials](Crafting%20materials.md) for more information.

## Items
All items in Project Chaos have had their normal stats, equip-bonuses wiped, and sockets removed.

## Affixes
All equippable items can have 3 [prefixes](List%20of%20prefixes.md) and 3 [suffixes](List%20of%20suffixes.md). All gems can have 2 [prefixes](List%20of%20prefixes.md) and 2 [suffixes](List%20of%20suffixes.md). 

All affixes have a list of tiers, and each tier has a range of values. The tier of an affix is determined by the item-level of the item. The higher the item-level, the higher the potential tier of the affix.
