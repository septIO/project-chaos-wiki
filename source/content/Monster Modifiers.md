Monsters can be _Normal_, _Magic_, _Rare_, or _Unique_:

- **Normal**: No additional modifiers.
- **Magic**: 1 modifier, increased health and damage.
- **Rare**: 2-3 modifiers, increased health and damage.
- **Unique**: 4 modifiers, increased health and damage.

**Magic Monsters**: When a monster is promoted to **Magic**, all nearby monsters of the same type are also promoted with identical modifiers.

**Rare Monsters**: When a monster is promoted to **Rare**, 4-6 additional **Normal** monsters spawn nearby with increased health.

**Unique Monsters**: All Rare (as in WoW Rare mobs, Silver Dragon frame, don't get confused) monsters are automatically upgraded to **Unique**. They always have 4 modifiers and spawn with 3-4 **Normal** minions.

Each modifier boosts item drops by increasing quantity or rarity. These effects multiply with a player's existing Item Quantity and Item Rarity bonuses.
